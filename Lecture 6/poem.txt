Polygot Longing
Free verse by Ray Nicholus
Not a day does pass that I do not think of you. The memories never rust.
Without you I feel small.
Talk of a future without you is empty. For this I have no visual.
Basic functions are now difficult to bear. Defeating loneliness is my main objective.
Seeing your photo resets my progress. But I cannot part with this perl.
I often wonder, almost every night, what have I to live for?
Transcendence marked our apex.
To end my mourning, to your memories, I say
Go.
